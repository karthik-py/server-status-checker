The code attempts to establish a connection to a server specified by server_address and server_port.
If the connection is successful, the code records the server status as "up" by calling record_server_status(True)
and prints a message to the console indicating that the server is up (print('Server is UP')).
  If there is an issue during the connection attempt (e.g., timeout, socket error, or SSL error), the code catches the corresponding exception types (socket.timeout, socket.error, or ssl.SSLError).
It then records the server status as "down" by calling record_server_status(False).
The code sends an email alert using send_email_alert(str(e)), where str(e) provides information about the specific error that occurred.
Finally, it prints a message to the console indicating that the server is down, along with details about the error (print(f'Server is DOWN. Error: {str(e)}')).
